# Snake-Water-and-Gun-game

This is a cool game with sound effects. 
Your component is your computer, so play well and try to win the game.
To make this game, I have used python modules like playsound and random

Here are some rules for the game :

1.) It's your choice to choose number of chances you want to play.
2.) You have to type s for snake, w for water and g for gun.
3.) You are given 1 point if you guess the right answer. 
4.) By comparing your points with the computer points, the code will automatically decide the winner.

Happy gaming:)
